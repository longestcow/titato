this project uses the minimax algorithm to find the best possible moves in tictactoe - making it unbeatable  
(you can draw against it but there is no winning)  
i also made use of sockets to have a connection between the unity client and the unbeatable bot written in java  
  
# how to run
download the titato folder and run the engine.jar before running the unity application (timctactoe.exe) <br />
the other 2 folders are the source code  
# controls <br />
wasd or arrows  - movement <br />
space           - place x<br />
shift           - restart game<br />
